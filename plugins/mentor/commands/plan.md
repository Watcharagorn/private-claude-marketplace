# mentor — plan

You are entering the mentor plan harness. Read-only-during-planning is enforced
by the plugin's marker-driven edit gate, which works even under
`bypassPermissions`.

Do these in order:

1. **Arm the plan gate — run this FIRST, exactly once, before any reading or drafting:**

   One guard before you arm: if another framework already owns the plan of record for
   this work (a spec-kit `tasks.md` phase, a Jira epic — decide from what the user
   asked, not by sniffing the repo), do **not** arm. Point at that framework's own next
   command instead. This sits before the arm deliberately:
   nothing releases this worktree's `.planning.<wt-id>` marker (or a live legacy
   `.planning`) but an approved plan.

   ```bash
   [ -d "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks" ] || { echo "ERROR: CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT unresolved or stale — do not search the plugin cache or hardcode a version path; ask the user to /reload-plugins or restart" >&2; exit 1; }
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/begin-plan.sh" [<target-slug>]
   ```

   Pass the target plan's slug as the one optional argument whenever the request
   names an existing `.mentor/plans/<slug>/` dir (a named plan, a split child). It is
   what lets `begin-plan.sh` print `ALREADY APPROVED` for an approved or in-progress
   plan (and arm nothing), and WARN when a live sibling worktree owns the slug (see
   "also armed elsewhere" below). Leave it off for a brand-new topic with no slug yet.

   This writes THIS WORKTREE's own `.planning.<wt-id>` marker (`plans/` itself stays
   shared across every worktree). From this point, `plan-gate.sh` blocks every repo
   source edit **in this worktree** until the plan is approved — a sibling worktree
   plans and edits independently. The only file you write during planning is the
   Markdown plan at `<repo>/.mentor/plans/<slug>/plan.md` (inside the repo, but the
   `.mentor/` tree is exempt from the gate). Read the script's stdout:
   - **`Plan gate NOT armed`** (another live session in this worktree, or a legacy
     repo-wide marker): don't re-run `begin-plan.sh` to force it; surface the printed
     owner/age and ask. Only on the user's explicit authorization, and only for the
     same-worktree case, re-run with `--override-foreign-marker`; a legacy marker is
     waited out or removed by hand only with the user's explicit OK. Never delete a
     marker yourself.
   - **`also armed elsewhere:`** lines are informational — don't re-run, don't wait.
   - **`CONTEXT:`** lines: mention them to the user and continue — the context gate
     only warns.
   - **`ALREADY APPROVED: <slug>`** is not an error: that plan is already approved (or
     in progress) and this worktree may build it, so nothing was armed. Invoke
     `Skill({"skill": "mentor:planning"})` and go straight to its "After Proceed —
     implement in the main thread {#implement}" section for that slug, after the check
     its Step 0 names for this case. To re-plan it instead, run `plan-state.sh
     set <slug> draft` and re-run step 1 — safe here, since nothing was armed.

2. **Immediately call `Skill({"skill": "mentor:planning"})` and follow it end
   to end** (unless step 1 printed `ALREADY APPROVED`, above).
   At the approval step, take the option list from the **option-set table** in the
   skill's `{#approve}` section — it fixes the order, including an oversized plan
   (which leads with **Split into multiple plans**).
   Do not improvise the list here: one copy of it, in the skill, is the only way it
   stays right. Each option maps to an `approve-plan.sh` invocation the skill
   specifies; all of them validate the plan and release the gate except Split and
   Keep planning, which stay in planning. Split returns to this same
   question with the children's headers, where each child is approved individually —
   never one blanket yes over the set.

3. **Proceed** — the main thread implements the plan per the skill's `{#implement}`
   section. After a Split, Proceed only releases the gate for the approved children;
   each is built later by running `/mentor:plan <child-slug>`, which goes straight to
   implementation for an approved child. **Deliver plan only**
   releases the gate and then STOPs, exactly as the skill states — it does not
   implement in this session.

**Never re-run step 1 once it has armed the gate.** `begin-plan.sh` resets THIS worktree's
`.planning.<wt-id>` marker's mtime (or the legacy `.planning`'s, in the empty-wt-id
fallback), and `approve-plan.sh` then refuses to release a plan file older than the
marker — stranding a finished plan unapprovable.
