# mentor — merge

Invoke `Skill({"skill": "mentor:merging"})` and follow it end to end: it resolves
the open PR for the current branch (or `$ARGUMENTS` as a PR number), runs one
bounded `gh pr checks --watch`, triages a failure once — flake, this diff's
regression, or rot already on the base branch — has an independent verifier grade the
PR, and merges only on your explicit choice (or under a constitution that grants merge),
then walks the runbook's after-merge steps.
