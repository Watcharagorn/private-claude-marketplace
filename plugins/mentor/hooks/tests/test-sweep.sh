# test-sweep.sh — regression tests for `plan-state.sh sweep` (v2.33.0+).
#
# Contract under test:
#   • `sweep <pattern> [--roots policy|plans|repo] [--ignore-case]` searches <pattern>
#     across a NAMED ROOT SET, printing an accounting line FIRST and the hits after:
#         SWEEP: roots=N files=N hits=N
#         <path>:<line>:<text>            (one per hit)
#     The summary leads on purpose: on a broken sweep there are no hits at all, so the
#     summary IS the whole output, and on a long result set it must not scroll away from
#     the reader who has to judge whether the result is trustworthy.
#   • Exit codes mirror grep's own, so a caller that knows grep needs no new convention:
#     0 = hits found · 1 = read >=1 file, no match · 2 = read NO files (plus an explicit
#     `SWEEP: NOTHING-SEARCHED` line), or a usage error.
#   • Root sets:
#       policy (default) — worktree CLAUDE.md + worktree .claude/ + main repo .mentor/plans
#       plans            — main repo .mentor/plans
#       repo             — the whole worktree minus .git/ (.mentor/ INCLUDED)
#   • Reachability is the entire point. `.mentor/.gitignore` contains `*`, and a recursive
#     grep whose traversal root is at or above that file reads NOTHING under a grep that
#     honors ignore rules (ugrep does). `sweep` finds a directive in a gitignored handoff
#     note anyway, because `find` does the walking and `grep` only reads the explicit list
#     it is handed — the escape is structural, not a better flag.
#   • Worktree awareness: CLAUDE.md and .claude/ resolve via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
#     (this worktree's own checkout) while .mentor/plans resolves via git-common-dir (the
#     shared main repo). Using one resolution for both is wrong in a linked worktree.
#   • Portability: only POSIX grep flags. No -r/-R anywhere — recursion is find's job.
#     `-H` is mandatory: without it a single-file root prints a bare `15:` with no path.
#   • Binary files are skipped (-I) but still counted by find's denominator.
#
# Plus TEXT INVARIANTS over the REAL repo (not the sandbox): the non-portable flag this
# subcommand exists to retire must not reappear under plugins/mentor/, and each of the
# three prescribing skill sites must invoke `sweep`.
#
# SELF-REFERENCE NOTE: this file lives under plugins/mentor/, so it must never contain the
# retired flag as a contiguous literal — the invariant would then match itself and fail
# forever. Every mention below is split across a string concatenation on purpose. The same
# trap applies to anyone auditing `plugins/` for that flag by hand.
#
# Runs against a SANDBOX $HOME and throwaway git repos so it never touches real state.

# The old prescription, on this very fixture. Only meaningful under a grep that honors
# ignore rules; on GNU/BSD grep it "works" and would prove nothing, so it is gated.
# Detect the grep implementation, and expect it to DIFFER from the one an agent sees.
# Claude Code installs a `grep` shell FUNCTION into the Bash tool's shell that routes to
# its own bundled ugrep with `--ignore-files --hidden -I`; that function is not exported,
# so a suite launched as `bash test-sweep.sh` gets whatever `grep` is on PATH instead —
# here /usr/bin/grep, BSD grep 2.6.0-FreeBSD, which honors no ignore files at all. So the
# gate below usually skips, correctly: reproducing the old command's silent failure needs
# an ignore-aware grep. To exercise it, put a shim earlier on PATH that execs
# `claude -G --ignore-files --hidden -I` as ugrep and re-run — the suite then reports two
# extra passing assertions. Both implementations must give FAIL=0; that dual run is the
# real portability evidence, since the sweep itself uses no flag either one lacks.
