# test-approve-plan.sh — regression tests for approve-plan.sh.
#
# Contract: release the .planning gate ONLY when a non-empty Markdown plan
# exists that is NEWER than the marker (i.e. written this planning session).
# --deliver prints its directive (still printed when the gate is already
# open); unknown flags,
# including the retired --handoff (v4.2.0), are rejected before the marker is
# touched.
#
# v2.23.0 (worktree-scoped plan gate): the marker is now per-worktree —
# `.planning.<wt-id>` — with a bare legacy `.planning` reserved as a
# repo-wide fallback that only its own arming session may approve through.
# Ownership (sidecar `owner`/`owner_session`) scopes approval to THIS
# worktree's plans (or unowned ones, while no sibling worktree is planning);
# a live sibling marker excludes unowned plans too, reported by name rather
# than silently swept or silently dropped. MARKER below is retargeted to
# this (the "A") worktree's OWN suffixed marker; a second, linked worktree
# ("B", $WTB) exercises the cross-worktree cases.
#
# Section Q drives begin-plan.sh <slug>: an approved/in_progress plan owned by
# this worktree (or unowned) prints ALREADY APPROVED and writes no marker;
# foreign-owned or draft plans arm as before.
#
# Runs against a SANDBOX $HOME so it never touches real user state.
