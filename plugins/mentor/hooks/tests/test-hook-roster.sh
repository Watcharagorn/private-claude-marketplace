# test-hook-roster.sh — anti-regrowth pin for mentor's machinery surface (v3.0.0).
#
# The README's charter says what mentor is: two gates and a set of skills, with no
# component that drives a multi-step run by re-polling script verdicts. That is a claim
# about the file system, not just about prose, and prose alone has already failed to
# hold it once. The v1.0.0 slim-down deleted ~15 hooks; the plugin regrew from 32 to 79
# files in five weeks, largely through automated `/loom:learn` cycles that harvested a
# real lesson and landed it as a new hook or a new subcommand rather than as skill
# prose. Nothing in the repo noticed, because every individual addition was defensible.
#
# So the roster is pinned here. A new hook registration, or a new top-level script in
# hooks/, fails this test until someone amends the charter paragraph in README.md — the
# point being that the amendment is a deliberate act with a reviewer, not a side effect
# of a good idea. Deleting a hook fails too: the charter names what exists, and a
# silently-removed gate is as much a drift as a silently-added one.
#
# This complements, and does not replace, test-hooks-json-paths.sh — that one pins how
# the paths are written (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}, never absolute); this one pins which
# scripts are there at all.
