# test-plan-state.sh — regression tests for hooks/plan-state.sh (v2.4.0).
#
# Contract:
#   • EFFECTIVE state = the more advanced of the sidecar's state and the state
#     derived from plan.md's ✅ step ticks. No sidecar and no ticks → `unknown`,
#     NEVER `draft` — a plan that shipped months ago was not "never approved".
#   • `init` is idempotent and never LOWERS a state; `set` is an upsert, because
#     most plans predate the sidecar.
#   • Usage errors (unknown subcommand, invalid state, unknown slug) exit 1.
#     Everything environmental (no repo, no plans dir) is fail-soft: exit 0 with a
#     reason line on stderr — silent-empty is indistinguishable from "no plans", and
#     the calling skill would improvise a listing.
#   • `current` skips superseded plans and, inside a split group, reports the whole
#     group instead of silently picking whichever child agent finished last.
#   • v2.23.0 (worktree-scoped plan gate): `gate` reports one of FOUR tokens
#     (ARMED/STALE/ARMED_ELSEWHERE/RELEASED) for THIS worktree, with a per-token
#     `--verbose` field contract; `current` scopes to plans owned by this worktree
#     (or unowned) unless `--any`; `ensure-dir`/`init`/`relocate` stamp sidecar
#     `owner`/`owner_session`; `list --owners` adds a 6th OWNER column.
#   • v5.0.0: every sidecar write MERGES, so a pre-5.0 sidecar's origin/parent/
#     priority/category/deferred_from survive untouched and unread (section K7);
#     the retired subcommands and flags are usage errors, never silent no-ops.
#
