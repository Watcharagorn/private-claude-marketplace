# approve-plan.sh — validate the plan, release the plan gate.
#
# Run by the plan skill when the user makes an approval choice. Flags map 1:1
# to the approval options — the persisted repo mode is NOT read here; the
# user's explicit choice decides:
#   (no arg)   — approve: validate, release the gate, implementation begins;
#                prints the subagents-first (SDD) execution directive.
#   --deliver  — approve, but the plan file is the DELIVERABLE: prints a
#                DELIVER-ONLY soft-stop directive (no implementation).
#   --handoff  — approve, then hand off: prints a directive to write a
#                /mentor:handoff doc for the next agent and STOP.
#   anything else — usage error, exit 1, marker untouched.
#
# There is deliberately NO flag for "hand off WITHOUT approving". That option
# ("Pause — still drafting") runs no script at all: the gate stays armed and the
# plan stays `draft`. Adding a --handoff-draft flag here would re-create the
# `approved` promotion below as a side effect, which is the bug it exists to avoid.
#
# Marker resolution (v2.23.0 — per-worktree gates): this worktree's OWN marker
# (`.planning.<wt-id>`) is used if present. Otherwise, a live LEGACY bare
# `.planning` (the reserved pre-upgrade repo-wide marker) is used ONLY when its
# `session=` matches this session — a session that never armed the legacy
# marker must not be able to sweep the whole repo and delete another session's
# marker out from under it; a session/owner mismatch REFUSES instead, marker
# untouched. With neither marker present/live, this is the gate-already-open
# branch below. An empty wt-id (git failure, `.git/` cwd, bare repo) makes the
# own-marker path identical to the legacy path, so that case falls straight
# into the ordinary own-marker branch with no session check — unchanged
# pre-upgrade behavior.
#
# Validation (only while a marker is resolved above): the newest Markdown plan
# owned by this worktree (or unowned, when no sibling worktree marker is live)
# must be non-empty AND newer than the resolved marker (the marker's mtime is
# the session start — begin-plan.sh — so a stale plan from a prior session can
# never release the gate). On failure the marker stays (gate CLOSED), exit 1.
# While ANY sibling worktree's marker is live, an unowned plan is excluded from
# both validation and the promotion sweep below (reported by name) — ownership
# stamping happens at plan-dir creation time but is model-followed, not
# hook-enforced, so it can't be trusted alone to tell two worktrees' drafts
# apart.
#
# Idempotent-directive rule: when the gate is already open, validation and
# release are skipped, but --deliver/--handoff STILL print their directive —
# a re-run must never silently downgrade a no-implementation instruction.
#
# Plan state (v2.4.0, widened v2.14.0): EVERY approval path — no-arg, --handoff,
# --deliver — promotes this session's plans to `approved` in their .state.json
# sidecars. Approval is approval: the flags only change what happens NEXT
# (implement now / hand off / deliver), not whether the plan was approved. Leaving
# --handoff plans at `draft` made plan-track refuse them in the next session
# ("the gate never released" — but it did). See the promotion block for why the
# candidate set is snapshotted before the marker is deleted. Promotion also
# stamps `owner`/`owner_session` (this worktree) on any previously-unowned plan
# it promotes — see _promote_plan below.
#
# Approval-sweep shield (v2.17.0): a candidate whose sidecar carries origin:"deferred"
# (a stub born via /mentor:defer mid-session) is SKIPPED, not promoted — it stays
# `draft` until `plan-state.sh claim <slug>` clears origin. The promotion write itself
# is now flag-style (`--state approved`, no other flags beyond --owner/--owner-session
# when stamping), so it never touches deps/origin/group/order — the old fixed-positional
# write clobbered them back to defaults on every promotion, which is exactly what made a
# shield here pointless before the rework.
