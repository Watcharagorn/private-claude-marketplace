#!/usr/bin/env bash
# plan-gate.sh — PreToolUse:Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit
#
# The single fail-closed edit gate of the mentor plan harness. It keys off TWO marker
# forms under <repo>/.mentor/plans/ (v2.23.0, per-worktree gate): this worktree's own
# `.planning.<wt-id>` (armed by begin-plan.sh, released by approve-plan.sh — scoped to
# ONE git worktree) and the legacy bare `.planning` (a pre-upgrade repo-global marker —
# blocks EVERY worktree until released/stale). Either live marker denies; the gate
# holds even under bypassPermissions: PreToolUse hooks deny independently of
# permission mode.
#
# While a marker is present, ALLOW targets OUTSIDE the repo working tree AND mentor's
# own in-repo state dir (<repo>/.mentor/ — where the plan file now lives). Any OTHER
# in-repo target — or an unresolvable/absent path — is DENIED. FAIL-CLOSED.
#
# Bash is NOT matched: the gate covers Claude's near-universal edit path
# (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit); the skill instructs against repo-mutating
# shell commands during planning but does not enforce it.
#
# Staleness: a marker older than 8h is treated as released (a crashed planning
# session must never permanently lock out editing). Checked ONLY for writes the gate
# would otherwise DENY: a gate-exempt .mentor/ write (an ordinary plan.md revision
# hours into a live session) must never silently release a marker as a side effect.
# Multi-marker self-heal (v2.23.0): reaching that point evaluates BOTH the own and
# legacy markers independently — every stale one is deleted, EACH WITH ITS OWN NAMED
# NOTICE (which marker, whose session, its age) — and the write is denied only if at
# least one marker is still live afterward. This covers own-live+legacy-stale (heal
# the legacy so it can't re-block every worktree once the own marker later releases —
# still deny, the own marker is live), own-stale+legacy-live (heal own, deny on
# legacy), and both-stale (heal both, allow). A silent release is later
# indistinguishable from an approval, so every deletion — own or legacy — prints a
# notice; nothing here is ever pruned quietly.
#
# Independently of the marker, a direct write to a plan's `.state.json` sidecar is always
# denied — plan-state.sh is its only writer. That check runs before the marker check
# because sidecars are edited mostly at close-out, when the gate is already released.
#
# Neither marker present → exit 0 (not planning). Cannot resolve the repo → exit 0
# (nothing to protect). Exit 2 = block (stderr shown to the agent).
