#!/usr/bin/env bash
# plan-state.sh — the ONE plan-state API. Read and write .mentor/plans/<slug>/.state.json
# (and, via `tick`, the ✅ step marks in plan.md that the sidecar's effective state derives from).
#
# Not a hook: skills call it as a plain Bash command, like approve-plan.sh.
# It exists so no skill ever hand-rolls the sidecar JSON, and so the three places
# that used to resolve "the current plan" with their own `ls -t` share one answer.
#
# v2.23.0: the plan-gate marker is per-worktree (`.planning.<wt-id>`, one per linked
# worktree, legacy bare `.planning` reserved repo-global — see `gate` below and
# lib/state.sh's state-layout header); plans stay SHARED across every worktree,
# tracked by an `owner`/`owner_session` pair on the sidecar (stamped by ensure-dir/
# init/relocate — see `current --any`, `list --owners`, and `query`'s `owner` field).
#
# v5.0.0: every sidecar write MERGES into the existing object (lib/state.sh,
# mentor_plan_state_write), so keys this script no longer manages — a pre-5.0
# sidecar's origin/parent/priority/category/deferred_from — are left in place, unread.
#
#   init <slug> [--group G] [--order N] [--deps a,b]
#       Create the sidecar as `draft`. Idempotent and never LOWERS an existing
#       state — re-running it on an approved plan keeps it approved. --deps sets the
#       initial dependency slugs (cycle-checked, same as set-deps).
#
#   start <slug> [any init flag]
#       ensure-dir + init in ONE call; prints only the plan.md path on stdout.
#
#   set <slug> <state> [--note "…"]
#       Upsert (create-then-set): most plans predate the sidecar. <state> is one of
#       draft approved in_progress implemented failed superseded.
#       The note is REPLACED every time, so a plain `set` clears a stale failure note.
#
#   set-deps <slug> a,b
#       Replace <slug>'s deps wholesale with the given comma-separated plan slugs
#       (empty string clears them). Unknown slugs are allowed — the dep plan may be
#       written later. Refuses a write that would create a dependency cycle (direct
#       self-cycle or transitive): fail-soft, stderr warning, no write.
#
#   tick <slug> <N>
#       Append ✅ to the Nth step line in plan.md's `## Implementation steps` section
#       (idempotent — already-ticked is a no-op) — replaces hand-rolling an Edit to
#       find and mark that exact line, whose placement is load-bearing (a tick on
#       the wrong line reads as the step never having started). No such step at N →
#       fails loud, no write. Reports drift before editing, then records the new
#       hash on success. The tick itself still works without jq or a sha256 tool.
#
#   record-write <slug>
#       Record plan.md's current sha256, preserving every other sidecar key.
#       Idempotent, never edits plan.md; a missing plan is an error.
#
#   drift <slug>
#       known|changed|unknown compared with the last tracked write. Read-only;
#       legacy sidecars and an unavailable sha256 tool read unknown.
#
#   list [--group G] [--owners]
#       One row per plan: ordinal, EFFECTIVE state, slug, group, order — and, with
#       --owners, a 6th OWNER column (the wt-id from the sidecar, "-" when unowned).
#       Grouped, ordered within a group, `superseded` and `unknown` last. The default
#       5-column shape is byte-compatible with pre-2.23.0 output.
#
#   current [--any]
#       The current plan, scoped to plans OWNED by THIS worktree (or unowned) — a
#       write target must never resolve to a sibling worktree's in-flight draft.
#       --any drops the filter for a deliberate, repo-wide read. Skips superseded.
#       When the answer belongs to a split group it prints the whole group and says
#       so, instead of silently picking one of N children.
#
#   query [select] [filter] [output]
#       The ONE filterable read surface. Repo-wide JSON array by default: one object
#       per plan dir with a plan.md — {kind: "plan", slug, state (effective), group,
#       order, owner, deps: [{slug, missing}], steps: {ticked, total}}. `missing` is
#       true when no such plan dir exists, so a consumer never re-resolves a dep
#       against the array by hand.
#
#       select   --slug S          just that plan
#       filter   --state --open --closed --group --owner W --unowned --deps-missing
#                --match GLOB
#                AND-combined; a comma-separated value ORs within that ONE flag.
#                "open" means effective state NOT in {implemented, superseded}.
#       output   --format json|table|slug|count|tsv   (json default)
#                --fields a,b      dot paths (steps.total, owner); tsv/table render
#                                   null as `-`
#                --sort F --limit N
#
#       A fixed ~3 subprocesses scan every sidecar and plan.md regardless of plan count.
#
#   context
#       CONTEXT: HIGH|WARN|OK|UNKNOWN (~N tokens) — advisory only, every level proceeds.
#       context-gate.sh passes every slash-prefixed prompt, so a slash command that
#       starts an implementation would otherwise get no reading.
#
#   dir [--plans]
#       The repo-scoped mentor dir (<repo_root>/.mentor via git-common-dir, so linked
#       worktrees share one; mentor_no_repo_state_dir outside a repo) — one path on
#       stdout. Skills call this instead of hand-rolling the derivation: the inlined
#       copies drifted, and most dropped the no-repo fallback.
#
#   gate [--verbose]
#       ARMED|STALE|ARMED_ELSEWHERE|RELEASED — exactly one token on stdout (line 1,
#       always — bare `gate` and `gate --verbose` alike), reporting the plan-gate
#       marker's status for THIS worktree (v2.23.0 — one `.planning.<wt-id>` marker
#       per worktree; see lib/state.sh's state-layout header for the full scheme):
#         ARMED           this worktree's OWN marker is live, or the legacy repo-
#                          global `.planning` marker is live (it blocks every
#                          worktree) — a write HERE would be denied right now.
#         STALE           the own or legacy marker exists but is older than
#                          MENTOR_PLAN_MARKER_STALE_MIN (lib/state.sh, ~8h) —
#                          plan-gate.sh/begin-plan.sh haven't pruned/healed it yet,
#                          but every other caller already reads it as not-armed.
#         ARMED_ELSEWHERE no own/legacy marker at all, but a SIBLING worktree's
#                          marker is live — an independent gate; it does not block
#                          writes here.
#         RELEASED        no marker at all (outside a repo — the `_no-repo`
#                          fallback — always reads RELEASED too).
#       This answers "is the gate armed HERE", not "should it be" — a caller that
#       instead needs "we're inside a repo and planning should have started" wants
#       a different check.
#       READ-ONLY: gate never deletes or heals a marker. That stays true even though
#       it is no longer the ONLY thing that could remove one — two removers exist now
#       (plan-gate.sh's self-heal on a would-deny write, and begin-plan.sh's stale-
#       sibling prune on arm), each printing its own named notice before removing
#       anything, so a marker is never released silently; gate must never become a
#       third, silent one.
#       --verbose is strictly additive: bare `gate` is unchanged (callers'
#       `[ "$(… gate)" = "ARMED" ]` string-equality checks depend on staying exactly
#       one token — and on ARMED_ELSEWHERE reading as "not armed for me" by that same
#       equality check). The per-token field contract below is
#       NORMATIVE — exactly these fields, nothing else:
#         ARMED           marker= owner_session= owner_cwd= owner_worktree=
#                          age_min= affected_plans= — the mentor_marker_field/
#                          mentor_marker_age_min facts plan-gate.sh's own deny
#                          message already computes, plus the mentor_newly_planned
#                          slugs approve-plan.sh would promote to `approved` if run
#                          right now (unfiltered when the armed marker is the legacy
#                          one — mirrors approve-plan.sh's legacy_mode, which is
#                          unfiltered too).
#         ARMED_ELSEWHERE one `elsewhere=<wt-id> session=<sid> worktree=<path>
#                          age_min=<n>` line per live sibling marker, nothing else.
#         STALE/RELEASED  bare token only — there is no "owner" to report.
#
# EFFECTIVE state (see lib/state.sh): the more advanced of the stored state and the
# state derived from plan.md's ✅ step ticks. A forgotten `set` therefore costs
# nothing, and a pre-2.4.0 plan dir with no sidecar reads `unknown` — never `draft`.
#
# Exit codes: 1 for a usage error (unknown subcommand, bad state, missing/unknown
# slug) — mirroring approve-plan.sh. Everything environmental is fail-soft: no repo,
# no plans dir, no jq, nothing to report → empty stdout, ONE reason line on stderr,
# exit 0. Silent-empty would be indistinguishable from "no plans" and the calling
# skill would improvise a listing. Exceptions: drift prints unknown without a
# registry; record-write needs an existing plan and exits 1 without a repo/registry.

# a plan is closed `implemented`, this is the last chance to write the ones that
# actually passed, which is why this fires exactly here. A false positive here is cheap

# --- query engine ---------------------------------------------------------------
# `query` is deliberately shaped around subprocess COUNT, not code brevity: a fixed,
# small number of spawns REGARDLESS of plan count — one jq over every sidecar, one awk
# over every plan.md, one jq that builds and filters the entries. `_plan_walk` (the
# `list`/`current` source) calls a jq per field per plan, which on a 34-plan repo cost
# hundreds of spawns for what is really two passes over the same bytes. Both readers
# agree because both derive "effective state" from the same stored-vs-ticks rule
# (mentor_plan_effective_state's rank comparison, reimplemented below over
# batch-scanned data rather than re-read per plan).

# _query_sidecars — ONE jq spawn for every plan dir's .state.json, emitting
# `{order: [<slug>…], map: {<slug>: <sidecar>}}`. `order` preserves the bash GLOB
# order the dirs were read in (the order `query` emits entries in); jq's own `keys`
# sorts by codepoint, which disagrees with glob collation on `-` under some locales
# and would silently reorder the array. Each sidecar is streamed as `<slug><TAB><json-on-one-line>`
# so the slug rides WITH its data: a positional zip against a parallel slug list
# would silently shift every later plan the moment one sidecar is missing. `tr -d`
# is safe because a raw newline cannot appear inside a JSON string (it must be
# escaped as \n), so collapsing a pretty-printed sidecar to one line never changes
# what it parses to. A corrupt sidecar yields `null` from `fromjson?` and is treated
# as "no sidecar" — the same fail-soft reading mentor_plan_state_field gives it,
# rather than aborting the whole query.

# collapses under `read`'s IFS handling).
#
# It folds together THREE per-plan reads that were separate processes before:
# mentor_plan_tick_counts' awk, and mentor_plan_header_field's two `sed -n '1,20p'`
# pipelines for the isolation header's group/order. All three want the same file, and
# two of them want only its first 20 lines, so one pass serves all of them.
#
# The step-line match uses MENTOR_STEP_LINE_PATTERN — the SAME shared pattern
# mentor_plan_tick_counts and mentor_plan_tick_step match against — so `query`'s step
# counts can never disagree with what `tick` writes.
# The header extractions mirror mentor_plan_header_field's two `sed` expressions
# exactly (first match within lines 1-20 wins). `[*][*]` rather than `\*\*`: a
# backslash-escaped literal is undefined behavior in a dynamic awk regex on some
