# PostToolUse:Write|Edit
#
# Opens the mentor Markdown plan (plans/<slug>/plan.md) for review ONCE, the first time it is
# created; later Write/Edits refresh it in place (Live Preview / the editor reloads when the
# file changes on disk). mentor:previewing opens its own review page, so no HTML path is handled
# here.
#
# Plan and page in sync (v4.0.0): when the edited plan has a review page at
# .mentor/reviews/<slug>/review.html, every Write/Edit of that plan.md also returns a PostToolUse
# additionalContext reminder to regenerate the page's changed sections (mentor:previewing §7)
# before the turn ends. The reminder runs before the open-once and off-switch exits below and
# ignores MENTOR_PLAN_OPEN, which governs opening only.
#
# Opener precedence — set MENTOR_PLAN_OPENER in ~/.claude/settings.json env (default "auto"):
#   auto   - open the plan as a focused VSCode editor tab via the VSCode CLI (`code -r`), so you
#            can toggle Markdown preview (⇧⌘V); without a VSCode CLI, the OS default handler.
#   vscode - same as auto.
#   chrome - Chrome cannot render raw Markdown, so this falls back to the OS default handler.
#   system - legacy: OS default opener (open / xdg-open / wslview).
#
# VSCode CLI is auto-detected (code, code-insiders, cursor, windsurf, codium); override with
# MENTOR_PLAN_VSCODE_BIN. Set MENTOR_PLAN_OPEN=off to disable opening entirely.
# MENTOR_PLAN_OPEN_DRYRUN=1 makes each opener print its name instead of launching (for tests).
#
# Scoped strictly to the plugin's own plan files — any other Write/Edit is ignored.
# Non-blocking: always exit 0.
